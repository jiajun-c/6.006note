# Algorithm and Computation
[TOC]
## 1.define the problem

## 2.define the algorithm

What's the algorithm, algorithm is usualy a function from the input to 
the output.

$f: I \to O$

## 3. prove the correct of the algorithm

### 3.1 inductive hypothesis

If the algorithm is right in the fist k elements, then we prove the k+1

## 4. The efficiency of the algorithm
We only count the operations, we expect it yo run different according to the 
size of the input.
